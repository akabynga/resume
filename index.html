                    SAP Scouting is a solution that brings all the information that an American Football organization
                    collects about each prospect to one place by creating player-centric data records that provide
                    everyone in the season with a unified view of each player. The application has embedded logic that
                    makes sure that people see the most important, up-to-date information (as defined by the customer)
                    on each prospect at any moment in time. The application is based on the SAP HANA platform, with most
                    of its logic written in SQL on the DB level. XS Engine (SAP HANA proprietary JavaScript server side
                    platform which utilizes Mozilla's SpiderMonkey JS runtime) serves as middle tier with REST and basic
                    HTTP capabilities support. On the UI side SAP Scouting heavily relies on SAP UI5, which is another
                    proprietary UI library from SAP.
